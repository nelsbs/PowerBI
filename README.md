## About this project
A Beginner's Guide to Power BI with Maven Analytics Challenge!

Welcome to a project that would help you if you are a Power BI Beginner. In this venture, I have intentionally taken the road less complex to ensure that even beginners in the realm of Data Analytics can join the journey.

Step 1: I began by unraveling the data, using the mighty tool known as Power Query. The aim here is to gain a solid understanding of our data. While doing so, I performed some gentle data transformations, keeping complexity aside.

Step 2: With all our data in Power BI, I took a moment to double-check the data types, ensuring they are align with the DAX** functions data type requirements. The goal here was to include only what's essential for our analysis, leaving no room for unnecessary records.

Step 3: The star schema emerges as our trusted companion for this step. I created clear, one-to-many (1:*) relationships, dividing our tables into Fact and Dimensions. Fact tables include DAX measures, while dimensions tables store the attributes.

Step 4: I created the scoring DAX measure, simplifying the complex by awarding 1, 3, and 5 to the bottom, medium, and top columns scores, with the aim to make the results easier to grasp.

Step 5: The project culminates in the creation of DAX measures for all visualizations in the report. I've embraced minimalism in design, ensuring that the report is understandable in the shortest possible time.

The minimalistic design of the report was created in CANVA. This design approach ensures that your experience is not only insightful but also smooth, without any performance hiccups.
